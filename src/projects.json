This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, SQL, API, front-end integration…\nThe console is a command interpreter designed to manage the AirBnB objects of our project:\n• Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)\n• Retrieve an object from a file, a database, etc.\n• Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc.)\n• Update attributes of an object\n• Destroy an object",

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\nComing Soon.",
